LEARNING OUTCOME
By Ozgur Serin

Over the course of writing these 10 basic C++ programs, I’ve learned so much more than just syntax and commands—I’ve started thinking like a programmer.

At the beginning, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I quickly realised how important even the smallest steps are. I learned how to take input from the user using cin, display output with cout, and even how to neatly format multi-line messages. These felt like basic tools at first, but they’re actually the backbone of user interaction.

Understanding variables and data types like int, string, and bool helped me realise how powerful data can be when stored and used properly. I explored arrays too, especially when working with lists like countries and their capitals, and I even used search techniques to find elements within them.

Control structures like if, else, and switch were big eye-openers. They allowed me to make my code responsive, to give it logic and purpose. Then came loops—for and while—which taught me how to repeat tasks and handle user input more dynamically. These were super useful for things like quizzes, counters, and login attempts.

One thing I didn’t expect to enjoy was string manipulation—comparing text values and validating input felt very hands-on and practical. I also began to understand the importance of error handling—how to give users feedback when something goes wrong, like an incorrect input or too many tries.

Before writing any code, I started breaking down problems into smaller steps and sometimes even writing out pseudocode to guide me. That process helped me think more clearly and logically.

I also began paying attention to how my code looked—adding comments, using clear names, and keeping things neat. It made it easier to read my own work later, and I can now share my code with more confidence, like when uploading to GitHub.

Using Visual Studio Code gave me a place to write, test, debug, and learn all in one environment. I feel more comfortable with it now, and it’s definitely helped build my confidence.

Looking back, each of these 10 programs felt like a small puzzle, but together they’ve helped me grow. I’m starting to think more about concepts like sequencing, iteration, and selection—not just what the code does, but how and why.

Understanding things like syntax, semantics, and pragmatics was tricky at first, but now I see how they all fit together in making code that works well and makes sense.

The most important thing I’ve learned? That this is just the beginning. I know I need to keep practicing, revisit the class PowerPoints, take better notes, and keep challenging myself with new problems. But I’m excited. I feel like I’ve started my real journey into programming—and I’m ready to keep going.
