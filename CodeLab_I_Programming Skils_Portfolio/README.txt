C++ Programming Skills Portfolio

This repository contains 10 individual C++ exercises designed to practice and demonstrate fundamental programming techniques as part of the Programming Skills Portfolio.

Each `.cpp` file is a self-contained C++ program that meets both the basic and advanced requirements outlined in the module brief.

#üìÅ Contents

| File Name               | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `01-CodingIsCool.cpp`  | Outputs "Coding is Cool" to the console using `cout`. |
| `02-SimpleSums.cpp`    | Declares and initializes two integers, sums them, and prints the result. |
| `03-Biography.cpp`     | Prompts the user to enter their name, hometown, and age. Handles full names and input validation. |
| `04-PrimitiveQuiz.cpp` | Asks the user the capital of France and accepts answers in various cases (e.g., "paris", "PARIS"). |
| `05-DaysOfTheMonth.cpp`| Uses a `switch` statement to tell the number of days in a month based on user input. |
| `06-BruteForceAttack.cpp` | Simulates a password guessing game with a max of 5 attempts before triggering an alert. |
| `07-SomeCounting.cpp`  | Demonstrates multiple `for` loops counting in different increments and directions. |
| `08-SimpleSearch.cpp`  | Searches for a name in an array using a loop. User can input the search term. |
| `09-Hello.cpp`         | A simple function that prints "Hello" to the console. |
| `10-IsItEven.cpp`      | A function checks if an input number is even or odd and returns a message. |

#‚úÖ Compilation & Execution

Each file can be compiled and run independently using a C++ compiler such as `g++`.

Example:

g++ 01-CodingIsCool.cpp -o CodingIsCool
./CodingIsCool

#üìù Notes

- Each program uses proper coding conventions.
- Programs are designed to be simple yet demonstrate core C++ concepts.
- Error handling and user input validation are included where applicable.
